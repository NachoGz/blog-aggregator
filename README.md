# üêä Blog Aggregator üêä

Blog Aggregator is an RSS feed aggregator written in Go. It allows users to register, add RSS feeds, follow/unfollow feeds, and browse posts from the feeds they follow.

## Features

- User registration and login
- Add RSS feeds from across the internet to be collected
- Store the collected posts in a PostgreSQL database
- Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
- View summaries of the aggregated posts in the terminal, with a link to the full post

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NachoGz/blog-aggregator.git
   cd blog-aggregator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Set up the database:

    Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database running (Postgres v15 or later.)
    Update the database URL in the configuration file `~/.gatorconfig.json`.
    Enter psql shell:
    - Mac: `psql postgres`
    - Linux: `sudo -u postgres psql`
    
   Create a new database named `gator`:

        CREATE DATABASE gator
    Connect to the database:

    `\c gator`

    Set the user password (Linux only):
    
    `ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'postgres'`

4. Run database migrations:

   ```sh
   cd sql/schema
   goose postgres <connection-string> up
   ```
   See the [Configuration](#Configuration) section for more information about the connection string.

5. Build the binary
   ```sh
   go build ./cmd/gator
   ```
